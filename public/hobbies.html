        <li><h2>Web Development</h2></li>
        <p>I started self-studying Web Developent recently and enjoy it a lot. I hope to turn it into a career in the future.</p>
        <li><h2>Japanese</h2></li>
        <p>I've been self-studying Japanese for one year. The reason I started was to make my trip to Japan easier.</p>
        <li><h2>Climbing</h2></li>
        <p>I've been climbing for two years and I love it. I mostly boulder indoors 2-3 times a week.</p>
